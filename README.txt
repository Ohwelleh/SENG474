SENG 474: Data mining offered at the University of Victoria.
These were the assignments I completed in the class during the spring term of 2021 (January - April)

In the LaTex Template Folder is the LaTex template source file I created and the PDF output. This template contains all the LaTex commands I used for completing the assignment. ** Note ** Errors will occur if you try to execute the LaTex file without the graph folder because the figure commands reference images within the graph folder.
